# Repository Push Summary

## Current Status
- Your repository is already initialized with Git
- It's connected to a GitHub remote at: https://github.com/ibrahimimran-jetbrains/JunieDemoWebStorm.git
- Your local branch is ahead of the remote by 1 commit
- The working tree is clean (no uncommitted changes)

## Authentication Issue
When attempting to push to GitHub, authentication failed because GitHub no longer supports password authentication for Git operations.

## Next Steps
Please refer to the `instructions.md` file I've created, which provides several methods to authenticate with GitHub:

1. **Use a Personal Access Token (PAT)** - The simplest method for command-line use
2. **Set up SSH Authentication** - More secure and doesn't require entering credentials each time
3. **Use GitHub CLI** - A convenient command-line tool for GitHub operations
4. **Use a Git Credential Manager** - Especially useful if you're using JetBrains IDEs

Since you're using WebStorm (based on the repository name), the easiest option might be:
1. Open this project in WebStorm
2. Go to Settings/Preferences > Version Control > GitHub
3. Add your GitHub account and authenticate
4. Use WebStorm's Git integration to push your changes (Git > Push)

Once you've set up authentication using any of these methods, you'll be able to push your commits to GitHub.
